Stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project
The project aims to refactor the VBA code. Using the refactored to perform a new analysis of stocks over 2017 and 2018. Then determine which stocks perform the best for each year. 

## Results
By refactoring the code, I looped through the data to collect the total daily volume and total return for 12 different stocks over 2017 and 2018. The arrays were set, and the worksheet was activated, so I began by creating the outputs. Then loop through the arrays by going through all the rows and columns and calculating based on each ticker symbol, then displaying the output and determining the results by color based on whether the ticker symbols were profitable. In addition, the refactored code ranch much faster than the green stocks analysis code.

## Summary
Refactoring the code made the code more efficient. And allowed us to analyze a different array of stocks quickly. The code ran much faster than the initial code.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
The advantage of refactoring code is that it allows you to go through the code and make it more efficient and easier to understand and read. Refactoring code will enable you to narrow down the steps resulting in faster output. The disadvantage of refactoring code is that sometimes the code will contain errors, or you may create new errors in the code.
